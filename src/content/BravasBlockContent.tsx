        Bravas was founded in 1998, and we have been hosting The Porró on our
        home beach of Castelafells ever since. All proceeds from The Porró get
        directly reinvested into our club.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every year (with one covid exception) we have been pouring our energy
        into The Porró, to provide our participants with the best ultimate
        experience that Castelldefels offer. It is our pleasure to share our
        beach with ultimate players from all over the world.
